# Portfolio project
During this project you will work on your own portfolio website.

## Collect proof of your work in the 'sintlucas' folder
* Any document you create (FDD.md, TDD.md, REVIEW.md and any other document)
* Screenshots of your scrum board during stand-ups (before and after).
* Video of (or parts of) the working application.
* Screenshots of tests you did and the changes you made afterwards.
* Notes created during meetings.
* ...

## General planning
A planning a scrum master could use:
[GENERAL_PLANNING.md](sintlucas%2FGENERAL_PLANNING.md)

## Analyse the FDD (Functional Design Document)
Make sure that you understand what you need to build:
* Study all available information in the Functional Design Document (FDD)
* Refine the requirements in the FDD and use diagrams (e.g. wireframes, flow charts).
* Debrief the client and update the FDD if necessary.
* Add proof to the sintlucas folder.

## Create a TDD (Technical Design Document)
Make sure that you understand how to build it:
* e.g. What stack/frameworks you will use (HTML/CSS/JS, Vue, Unity etc.)?
* e.g. How will the different parts work together (or how does the architecture look like)?
* e.g. If you're using OOP, what would the class diagram look like?
* e.g. Which data does your application need and how you will store it? Do you need an ERD diagram?
* e.g. How will you deploy it?
* e.g. Which parts won't be built?
* e.g. What are the risks?
* e.g. Are there any security risks and how will you deal with them?
* e.g. How important is the performance and how will you realise it?
* e.g. Who will maintain it?
* Add proof to the sintlucas folder.

## Prepare
* Create a project board in GitHub.
* Place the refined requirements in `GitHub Issues`.
* Prioritize the items with the MoSCoW-method. Use a label in `GitHub Issues` to indicate the priority.
  
## Realise: development
* Each lesson:
  * Open the Issues and update if necessary.
  * Are there any impediments in your way and should you ask for help?
  * Start developing on the items.

Don't forget:
* Commit and push your changes regularly.
* Check the result in the browser regularly.
* Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.
* Make sure that your code follows the code conventions.

## Test: bugfixing
* Test every item during development.
* Test your code in different browsers and on different devices.
* Test the result for speed by using the LightHouse tool in the browser's Developer Tools.

## Present/Discuss: review
* In English
* Show the issues.
* Show the result of each item you finished.
* Write down feedback you get in `REVIEW.md`.
* Add/change items (in Issues) based on the feedback in `REVIEW.md`.

## Feedback
* During the lessons you will get feedback on your work.
* In the last week you will present the results:
  * PREPARE
  * Show the end product.
  * PROVE that you met the criteria in ASSESSMENT.MD (sintlucas folder).
