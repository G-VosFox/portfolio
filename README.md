* Video of (or parts of) the working application.
* Screenshots of tests you did and the changes you made afterwards.

## General planning
A planning a scrum master could use:
[GENERAL_PLANNING.md](sintlucas%2FGENERAL_PLANNING.md)

## Analyse the FDD (Functional Design Document)
Make sure that you understand what you need to build:
* Study all available information in the Functional Design Document (FDD)
* Refine the requirements in the FDD and use diagrams (e.g. wireframes, flow charts).

## Analyse the TDD (Technical Design Document)
Read the TDD in the `sintlucas` folder.
 
## Prepare
* Create a scrum board in `GitHub Projects`.
* Place the refined requirements in `GitHub Issues`, or the backlog.
* Add just enough items to the `sprint backlog` in the scrum board's `To do` column.
  
## Realise
Each lesson:
* Open the Issues and update if necessary.
* Are there any impediments in your way and should you ask for help?
* Start developing on the items.

Don't forget:
* Commit and push your changes regularly.
* Check the result in the browser regularly.
* Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.
* Make sure that your code follows the code conventions.

## Test
* Perform tests on the application as described in the TDD.

## Review
* Show the result of each item in the `Done` column.
* Write down feedback you get in `REVIEW.md`.
* Add/change items in the backlog (in Issues) based on the feedback in `REVIEW.md`.

## Retrospective
* Complete the `RETROSPECTIVE.md` in the `sintlucas` folder.

## Presentation & Assessment
In the last week you will present the results:
  * Prepare for the presentation
  * Show the end product
  * Prove that you met the criteria in `sintlucas/ASSESSMENT.MD`
  * Create a video of the working application:
    * Before the Presentation & Assessment week, you must create a video of the working application.
    * The video should show the main functionalities of the application.
    * It should be a screencast with a voice-over.
    * The video should be a maximum of 5 minutes long.
    * Add the video to the `sintlucas` folder.
    * Give the video a clear name, e.g. `video-portfolio-website-your-name.mp4`.
  * You will be assessed on the criteria in `sintlucas/ASSESSMENT.MD`.
  * You will receive feedback on your work.
